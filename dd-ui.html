            <h1>User Interface</h1>
          
              <p>
                Throughout recent years I created a few wireframes for projects and websites. 
                One example was a player page I built for an Edutainment game called Digital Negotiator at NSCC. 
                Another one is a dialogue message box, and a few wireframes of an Android application for a quiz builder. 
                I have also done a couple of wireframe examples from a UI/UX class I took at NSCC. Most recently I have been developing UX screens for a unity project.
              </p>

              <h3>Digital Negotiator</h3>

              <P>
                Digital Negotiator is a web-based online trading card game, 
                where you learn about the Information Technology (IT) Industry 
                and community with your class in your Nova Scotia Community College Professional Practices for IT program.
              </P>

              <p>
                In Digital Negotiator, I created a player page, 
                where you see all your current 10 cards, 
                and what card you are trading for, and the status of the cards.
              </p>

              <h3>Vex Monsters</h3>

              <p>
                Vex Monsters is a 2D fantasy platform game, where you save monsters from an evil betrayer.  
              </p>

              <p>
                I made a sandbox video example. When the player hit an object (an NPC in the game). 
                There is a pop up of the dialogue box with their name and message. To go to the next message ,the player must press enter.
              </p>

              <br>

              <h3>Android Development</h3>

              <p>
                In my Android development class, I built a Quiz Builder, 
                where you could enter your name, play a quiz with questions, answers, and track your score. 
                It had up to 4 questions with 4 multiple choices to choose your answers. 
                It had error checking for if you didnâ€™t enter a name or choose the right answer for the questions. When you reach the end, it tells you your full score and asks if you want to play again.
              </p>

              <P>
                Before I created the app, I built a couple of storyboards that outline how it works.
              </P>

              <P>
                On the first screen, it will ask for your name. 
                Once you enter your name, you press the button down to continue and start the quiz. 
              </P>

              <img src="workExamples/Android/2QuizBuilder/Story Borad/QuizBuilderPage1.png" width="100%" alt="Vex Monsters example" />

              <p>
                The next few pages were pages of questions. 
                There was a list of the possible answers, and the questions.
              </p>

              <img src="workExamples/Android/2QuizBuilder/Story Borad/QuizBuilderPage2.png" width="100%" alt="Vex Monsters example" />

              <p>
                If you got the question right it was programmed to turn the selection green and if you got it wrong it turned red. 
              </p>

              <img src="workExamples/Android/2QuizBuilder/Story Borad/QuizBuilderPage2Answers.png" width="100%" alt="Vex Monsters example" />

              <p>
                The last page told you your overall score, and asked if you want to try again. 
                If the player selected try again, the app will reset back to the beginning.
              </p>

              <br>
              <br>

              <h3>User Interface Design and Development</h3>

              <p>
                In User Interface Design and Development, 
                I created a few wireframes for apps, and websites from templates . Here are these examples:
              </p>

              <img src="workExamples/UserInterface/Assignment 4/Sandox/Ast. 4 - Mk1 - DanielCox.jpg" width="100%" height="" alt="Vex Monsters example" />

              <p>
                On the top of the page is a place for the featured image for a restaurant. 
                After that is a description of the place, and then a few examples of their meals. 
                Finally is the footer with address and extra links and copyright information.
              </p>

              <br>

              <img src="workExamples/UserInterface/Assignment 5/Form Mockup, Coded/Mockup/Competitive Eating Form Mockup - Daniel Cox.jpg" width="100%" alt="Vex Monsters example" />

              <p>
                I created a wireframe for a sign up page. 
                The first screen asked for your personal information. 
                The second page asked for your contest you are entering in, and any emergency contact information. 
                The last page asked if you agreed to the terms of service.
              </p>

              <br>

              <p>
                The programs I used for the wireframes are  Photoshop, Illustrator, and Procreate.
