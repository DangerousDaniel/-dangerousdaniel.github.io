            <h1>PC Builds</h1>
  
           <p>
            I have built three PCs for myself and friends. 
            The first one for myself,It was a gaming pc that is a basic PC for 1080p gaming. 
            I brought the parts from the GPU, CPU, RAM, storage, power supply, motherboard, and case. 
            Being the first build, everything I brought was simple to install and the only long thing to wait for was setting up the computer. 
            I used this from 2016 - 2021. 
           </p>

           <P>This is my first PC build.</P>

           <p>
            The second I built for myself was a high end gaming pc, for 4k gaming. 
            I brought the similar part as last time, but the case was hard to work with and one bonus was RBG Fan everywhere. 
            I thought that it wouldn't be hard, but it ended up being the most annoying thing ever. 
            Just when I thought I got it to work, 
            I needed a controller to control the RBG and once that worked, 
            then a couple of the fans were fired. Oh great, I have to buy another fan and it is now fine. 
            It expects the RBG button on the case is  dead, 
            but thatâ€™s no worries because the software from the controller can control all of it. 
            I have been using this from 2021 - present. 
           </p>

           <P>This is the inside of my second PC build.</P>

           <p>
            The last one I built was for my best friend. 
            He brought a similar one from mine from before with RGB fans for the cpu water cooler. 
            This pc water cooler was a pain to install. But once you get the hang of it, it was party easy. 
            The computer has been running perfectly since we built it. He has been using it since 2021 - present. 
           </p>

           <P>This is my best friend PC build.</P>

           <p>
            Right now, I am interested in building a small tiny PC for myself. 
            That looks like a lot of fun and I can't wait to build it in a couple years or so.
